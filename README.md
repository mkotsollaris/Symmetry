Symmetry is a Layer-based Android application that provides the creation of many different kinds of shapes, that you can either change parameters or delete, depending on your preference!

Every feature in the application was developed from scratch (including the drawing algorithms, paint style, pallet etc.).
API minimum level: 14 (ice cream sandwich).
